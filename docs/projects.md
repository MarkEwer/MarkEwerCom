## Case Studies

### Microservices Migration
**Large-scale monolith decomposition**

Led the architectural redesign and migration of a legacy monolithic application to a microservices architecture, resulting in improved scalability and team autonomy.

**Challenge**: 10-year-old monolithic application with tight coupling and scalability issues

**Solution**: 
- Domain-driven design to identify service boundaries
- Strangler Fig pattern for gradual migration
- Event-driven communication between services
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes

**Results**: 
- 300% improvement in deployment frequency
- 50% reduction in mean time to recovery
- Enabled independent team scaling
