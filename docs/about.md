# About Me

## Hello! I'm Mark Ewer

I'm a passionate software architect and developer with extensive experience in building scalable, enterprise-grade applications. My journey in software development has led me through various roles, from hands-on development to architectural leadership, always with a focus on delivering value through well-designed systems.

## Professional Background

With a strong foundation in both traditional and modern software development practices, I specialize in:

- **Software Architecture**: Designing systems that scale, from monoliths to microservices
- **Agile Methodologies**: Implementing and optimizing agile processes for teams
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building end-to-end solutions with modern technologies
- **Technical Leadership**: Mentoring teams and driving technical excellence

## Core Expertise

### Architecture & Design Patterns
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Event Sourcing and Event-Driven Architecture
- Microservices and Distributed Systems
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Clean Architecture principles

### Technologies
- **Languages**: C#, TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: .NET Core, React, Vue.js, Node.js
- **Cloud**: Microsoft Azure, AWS
- **Databases**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions

### Methodologies
- Agile/Scrum development practices
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- Code review and quality assurance processes

## Philosophy

I believe in building software that not only solves today's problems but is designed to evolve with changing requirements. My approach emphasizes:

- **Simplicity**: Favor simple solutions over complex ones
- **Maintainability**: Write code that future developers (including yourself) will thank you for
- **Team Collaboration**: Foster environments where knowledge sharing and continuous learning thrive
- **User Focus**: Always keep the end user's needs at the center of technical decisions

## Beyond Code

When I'm not architecting systems or writing code, I enjoy:

- **Writing**: Sharing insights through blog posts and technical articles
- **Learning**: Staying current with emerging technologies and methodologies
- **Mentoring**: Helping other developers grow in their careers
- **Community**: Contributing to open-source projects and developer communities
